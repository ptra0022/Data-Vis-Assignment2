          This visualisation is designed for everyday Australians — the people on the roads each day, whether driving to work, commuting across town, or thinking about how policy shapes safety. It invites readers to see which states carry the greatest risk of alcohol‑related road deaths, and how those risks shift over time. By turning complex statistics into clear patterns, the story becomes less about numbers on a page and more about understanding where danger is concentrated, why it matters, and what it means for the journeys we all take.

          <p class="lead">This visualisation shows alcohol-induced death rates per 100,000 people across Australian states. Use the year selector to explore how risk levels shift over time. Darker shades indicate higher fatality rates, helping highlight regional patterns and long-term trends.</p>

          <h3 class="subhead">Did you know?</h3>
          <p class="note">
            The Northern Territory, Queensland, and Tasmania records some of the highest alcohol-induced fatality rates in Australia (throughout the years of 2020 to 2023),
            — a pattern shaped by their extensive rural road networks and higher speed zones.
            These conditions often mean longer travel distances, reduced enforcement coverage, and greater exposure to high-speed crashes.
            However, the Northern Territory shows a marked improvement in alcohol-induced death rates in
            2022 and 2023 — reflected by a noticeably lighter shade on the map compared to previous years. In contrast,
            2020 and 2021 were particularly severe, with NT shaded among the darkest regions nationally.

    <!-- ========== 02 TREND ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="trend" aria-label="National monthly trend of road fatalities">
      <h2>Are things getting better?</h2>
      <p class="lead">The long-term decline in monthly road fatalities from the late 1980s through the early 2010s reflects the impact of stronger road safety policies, widespread seatbelt use, safer vehicle design, and targeted enforcement such as random breath testing and speed cameras. Infrastructure upgrades and public awareness campaigns also played a role in steadily reducing deaths. However, from around 2013 onwards the trend stabilises, and in recent years there are signs of an uptick — likely linked to increased travel exposure, population growth, and behavioural factors such as distraction and fatigue. Seasonal spikes often coincide with holiday periods when road use is highest.</p>

    <!-- ========== 03 SMALL MULTIPLES ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="multiples" aria-label="State small multiples of monthly fatalities">
      <h2>How do states differ month-to-month?</h2>
      <p class="lead">This comparison highlights how road deaths vary month‑to‑month across Australia’s states and territories between 2020 and 2023. Larger states such as NSW and VIC show steadier patterns, reflecting their bigger populations and more consistent exposure. In contrast, smaller jurisdictions like the NT and TAS display sharp swings, where even a few incidents can cause noticeable spikes. These differences underline how population size, geography, and travel patterns shape volatility in fatality counts, with smaller states appearing more erratic while larger ones mask fluctuations through scale.</p>

    <!-- ========== 04 CRASH TYPE ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="type" aria-label="Crash type composition over time">
      <h2>What types of fatal crashes dominate?</h2>
      <p class="lead">This long‑term view shows that single‑vehicle crashes have consistently dominated Australia’s road fatalities since 2000. Their persistence highlights risks tied to factors like high‑speed rural travel, driver fatigue, alcohol, and loss of control incidents where no other vehicle is involved. Multiple‑vehicle crashes, while still significant, make up a smaller and steadier share of deaths. The stability of this pattern suggests that despite improvements in enforcement and vehicle safety, single‑vehicle crashes remain a stubborn challenge for road safety policy.</p>

    <!-- ========== 10 ALCOHOL VS FATAL CRASHES ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="alcohol-vs-fatal" aria-label="Alcohol vs Fatal Crashes">
      <h2>How do alcohol-related deaths compare to fatal crashes?</h2>
      <p class="lead">This comparison shows that alcohol‑related deaths remain consistently higher than deaths from fatal crashes between 2021 and 2023. Alcohol deaths rose sharply into 2022 before easing slightly in 2023, while fatal crashes followed a similar but less pronounced pattern, peaking in 2022 and then dropping more steeply. The gap between the two lines highlights alcohol’s outsized role in overall mortality, suggesting that while road safety measures may reduce crash fatalities, broader alcohol‑related harms remain a persistent challenge.</p>

    <!-- ========== 05 BUMP RANK ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="rank" aria-label="States ranked by fatality rate per 100,000">
      <h2>Rank movement — which states sit at the top?</h2>
      <p class="lead">This ranking view highlights how states’ relative road fatality risks have shifted between 2020 and 2023. The Northern Territory consistently sits at the top, reflecting its persistently high per‑capita fatality rate. Tasmania and South Australia also move upward at times, showing periods of elevated risk compared to peers. In contrast, larger states such as Victoria and New South Wales remain toward the lower end of the ranking, indicating comparatively safer outcomes per capita. The movement of lines makes clear that while some states hold steady, others fluctuate in their relative position, revealing how exposure, geography, and policy differences shape changing risk profiles.</p>

    <!-- ========== 06 TIME OF DAY ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="tod" aria-label="Time-of-day profile of fatal crashes by state">
      <h2>When do fatal crashes cluster?</h2>
      <p class="lead">This comparison shows that fatal crashes disproportionately cluster at night across every Australian state and territory. While daytime travel accounts for a larger share of overall exposure, nighttime periods — particularly late evening and early morning hours — carry a much higher risk of death. The pattern is especially pronounced in smaller jurisdictions, where fewer crashes overall make the night‑time share stand out even more. These findings highlight the dangers of reduced visibility, fatigue, and alcohol involvement after dark, reinforcing why night‑time enforcement and targeted safety measures remain critical.</p>

    <!-- ========== 07 SPEED ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="speed" aria-label="Distribution by posted speed limits">
      <h2>Speed environments</h2>
      <p class="lead">This long‑term view of NSW shows that high‑speed rural roads (100–110 km/h) consistently account for the largest share of road deaths from 1990 to 2022. While fatalities at lower speed bands (≤50 km/h and 60 km/h) remain present, they make up a much smaller proportion of the total. The persistence of deaths in the highest speed zones highlights the disproportionate risk of severe outcomes when crashes occur at rural highway speeds, where distance, enforcement challenges, and impact forces combine to drive fatality rates.</p>

    <!-- ========== 08 REMOTENESS ========== -->
    <section class="card" id="remote" aria-label="Remoteness composition">
      <h2>Urban vs regional/remote</h2>
      <p class="lead">This breakdown shows that most road deaths occur in Australia’s major cities and inner regional areas, reflecting where the majority of people live and travel. However, deaths in remote and very remote regions, while a smaller share overall, remain disproportionately high relative to their populations. These areas face unique risks — long travel distances, higher speed environments, delayed emergency response times, and limited access to trauma care — which amplify the severity of crashes. The persistence of these patterns highlights the challenge of improving road safety outside urban centres.</p>

    <section class="card" id="yoy" aria-label="Year-over-year change in fatality rate">
      <h2>Latest change in rates (YoY)</h2>
      <p class="lead">This snapshot highlights how road death rates shifted across states in the most recent year. The Northern Territory shows the largest improvement, with a sharp year‑over‑year decrease in deaths per 100,000 people. In contrast, South Australia and New South Wales record increases, signalling rising relative risk. Other states sit closer to zero change, suggesting more stable outcomes. The spread of results underscores how progress is uneven — with some jurisdictions making strong gains while others face setbacks.</p>
